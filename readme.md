# OneShot Fading Memory Release Preperation Utility

Requires Ruby

Requires an environment that can launch your mod

Requires running once on Windows, and once on Linux (something about Ruby having different behavior IDK)

- Pull your latest mod project repo
- Plop it down somewhere
- Run `<path/to/>main_executor.rb <path/to/mod/repo>` in terminal
- Look at it go!
- Result will be in `output` folder, in the same directory as `main_executor.rb`
